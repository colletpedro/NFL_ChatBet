# NFL Data Collection Plan

## Phase 1: Data Identification and Sources

### Available Data Categories

#### 1. **Game Statistics**
- **Team Performance**: Points scored, yards gained, turnovers, time of possession
- **Historical Records**: Win/loss records, home/away performance
- **Head-to-head**: Historical matchups between teams

#### 2. **Player Statistics** 
- **Offensive Stats**: Passing yards, rushing yards, receiving yards
- **Defensive Stats**: Tackles, sacks, interceptions
- **Special Teams**: Field goal percentage, punt/kick return yards

#### 3. **Advanced Metrics**
- **DVOA** (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average)
- **EPA** (Expected Points Added)
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of positive EPA plays
- **Pressure Rate**: QB pressures and sacks

#### 4. **External Factors**
- **Weather Conditions**: Temperature, wind, precipitation
- **Injuries**: Player availability and impact
- **Rest Days**: Days between games
- **Travel Distance**: For away teams

#### 5. **Market Data**
- **Betting Lines**: Point spreads, over/under
- **Line Movement**: Changes in betting lines
- **Public Betting %**: Where the money is going

## Phase 2: Data Collection Implementation

### Step 1: API Integration
```python
# Primary data sources to implement:
- nfl_data_py: Official NFL data
- Pro Football Reference scraping
- ESPN API for real-time updates
- Weather API integration
```

### Step 2: Database Design
```sql
-- Core tables needed:
- games (game_id, date, home_team, away_team, result)
- team_stats (team_id, game_id, stats_json)
- player_stats (player_id, game_id, stats_json)
- weather (game_id, temperature, wind, conditions)
- injuries (player_id, game_id, status)
```

### Step 3: Data Pipeline
1. **Daily Collection**: Injury reports, betting lines
2. **Weekly Collection**: Game results, player stats
3. **Real-time**: Live game updates during game time

## Phase 3: Data Processing

### Data Cleaning Tasks
- Handle missing values
- Standardize team names across sources
- Convert timestamps to consistent timezone
- Validate statistical anomalies

### Feature Engineering Plans
- Rolling averages (3, 5, 10 games)
- Momentum indicators
- Strength of schedule adjustments
- Home field advantage quantification

## Phase 4: Data Storage

### Storage Strategy
```

## Key Considerations

### Data Quality
- Cross-validate between multiple sources
- Implement automated quality checks
- Log all data anomalies
- Maintain data lineage

### Scalability
- Design for incremental updates
- Implement efficient storage
- Use caching for frequently accessed data
- Plan for historical data growth

### Legal/Ethical
- Respect API rate limits
- Follow terms of service
- Credit data sources
- For educational use only

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Install required packages and set up environment
2. **Short-term**: Implement basic data collection scripts
3. **Medium-term**: Build comprehensive pipeline
4. **Long-term**: Automate and maintain system

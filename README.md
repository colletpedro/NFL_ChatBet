## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip or conda
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nfl-prediction.git
cd nfl-prediction
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # For development
```

4. Set up configuration:
```bash
cp config/config.example.yml config/config.yml
# Edit config.yml with your settings
```

## 📊 Data Sources

The project uses multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis:

- **Historical Game Data**: Team statistics, scores, and outcomes
- **Player Statistics**: Individual performance metrics
- **Weather Data**: Game-time conditions
- **Injury Reports**: Player availability and health status
- **Betting Lines**: Market expectations and odds

See [docs/DATA_SOURCES.md](docs/DATA_SOURCES.md) for detailed information.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
# All tests
pytest

# With coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_data_loader.py
```

## 📈 Model Performance

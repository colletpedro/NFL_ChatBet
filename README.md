# NFL Game Prediction Model 🏈

A machine learning project to predict NFL game outcomes using historical data and advanced analytics.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust prediction model for NFL games by analyzing historical game data, team statistics, and various performance metrics. The model uses multiple data sources and machine learning techniques to provide accurate game predictions.

## 📊 Features

- Historical NFL game data collection and processing
- Advanced feature engineering for team performance metrics
- Multiple ML models for prediction (planned)
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Visualization of predictions and model performance

## 🚀 Quick Start
